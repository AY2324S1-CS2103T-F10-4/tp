## Input Formats

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

### Command Format

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `list [DAY]` can be used as `list` or as `list Mon`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME sb/SUBJECT`, `sb/SUBJECT n/NAME ` is also valid.

* Extraneous parameters added after commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit`, `undo`, `redo` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command typed is `undo 123`, it will be interpreted as `undo`.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my existing data to another machine?<br>
**A**: Overwrite the empty `tuitionconnect.json` file in the machine by deleting it and replacing it with the `tuitionconnect.json` that contains the data

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
